🚀 𝐔𝐧𝐥𝐨𝐜𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐬: 𝐂𝐨𝐟𝐟𝐞𝐞 𝐒𝐡𝐨𝐩 𝐒𝐚𝐥𝐞𝐬 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬 ☕📊

I recently worked on a 𝐝𝐲𝐧𝐚𝐦𝐢𝐜 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐝𝐚𝐬𝐡𝐛𝐨𝐚𝐫𝐝 to analyze coffee shop sales, uncovering key insights that can drive better business decisions. Using 𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐜𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠, 𝐦𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐬 𝐜𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧, 𝐩𝐢𝐯𝐨𝐭 𝐭𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐬, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐚𝐝𝐯𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐝 𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐭 𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠, I visualized key trends such as:

📅 𝐒𝐚𝐥𝐞𝐬 𝐏𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧𝐬 𝐛𝐲 𝐃𝐚𝐲 & 𝐇𝐨𝐮𝐫 – Sales peak during morning hours (7 AM – 10 AM) and gradually decline throughout the day. Friday records the highest weekday sales, while Saturday sees a dip.

📍 𝐒𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 – Hell’s Kitchen leads in revenue ($326,511.17), followed by Astoria and Lower Manhattan.

💰 𝐓𝐨𝐩-𝐒𝐞𝐥𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐬 – Barista Espresso takes the lead with $91,406.20 in sales, followed by Brewed Black Tea and Chai Tea.

🍵 𝐂𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐠𝐨𝐫𝐲 𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬 – Coffee dominates sales (39%), followed by drinking chocolate (28%).

📊 𝐂𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐫 𝐁𝐞𝐡𝐚𝐯𝐢𝐨𝐫 – The average bill per person stands at $4.69, with an average of 1.4 orders per person.

🔍 This project highlights how effective 𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐯𝐢𝐬𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐝𝐚𝐬𝐡𝐛𝐨𝐚𝐫𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 can provide valuable business insights.
